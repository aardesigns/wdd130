    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Alma Reynolds and I'm from Anchorage, Alaska. I'm the eldest of nine in my family, finishing up for my Applied Business Management Degree, and some of my favorite hobbies include, but are not limited to: arts and crafts, reading, video games, and spending time outdoors.</p>
    <main>And here's, for fun, two truths and a lie:</main>
    <ul><li>I have ridden a subway train in South Korea.</li><li>I have ridden a hot air balloon in New Mexico.</li><li>I have ridden a firetruck in Alaska.</li></ul>
    <p>Have fun guessing!</p>
