            <h1 class="subpage title">Physical Pieces</h1>
            <p>This section is dedicated to the more tangible pieces I've made. I find it very satisfying to be able to make something and to see the result of the work.</p>

            <img id="dress2-img" src="images/Bunny_Standing.png" alt="Bunny in dress 2">
            <h2>Star dress</h2>
            <p>While learning how to sew clothes, I made a couple of outfits for my Buil-A-Bear plush. Made from left over fabric from a revious project, this dress is my favorite.</p>

        <div>
            <img id="lamp-img" src="images/Lamp.png" alt="clay lamp">
            <h2>Clay lamp</h2>
            <p>This was made during a church activity focusing on the parable of the Ten Virgins. I had fun adding the embelishments, and this does work. The light that comes from it is dim though.</p>

            <h2>Mom's Birthday earrings</h2>
            <p>I've made several beaded jewlery, this pair of earrings one of them. This was made for a birthday gift.</p>
