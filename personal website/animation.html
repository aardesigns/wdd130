        <h1 class="home-title">Animation</h1>
        <p class="home-p">This page will be dedicated to my work brushing up on animation, both the principles and, later on,  tools used for making the animatics and the more finished products.</p>
        
        <h2>Principles of Animation</h2>
        <p>The Principles of Animation are the basics that give any animated piece life. The twelve principles are as follows:</p>
        
        <button class="accordion"><h4>Squash And Stretch</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Squash and Stretch is when the subject (character or object) does what the name suggests during movement, giving the subject the illusion of volume and weight. The most common example of this is a bouncy ball in animation, where is squashes down on impact with the ground and stretches out when it flies back up into the air.</p>
            <img src="images/bouncing_ball.png" alt="bouncing ball">
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><h4>Arc of Motion</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The bouncy ball example is also a good example of Arcs of Motion. Basically, nothing ever really moves perfectly straight. There’s always some form of curve that the subject would follow. In the picture above, our bouncy ball follows an arc on its path, cresting upwards before making its descent back to the ground.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><h4>Anticipation</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>This is a tell, a preemptive action, that tells the audience what main action is about to happen and when. Before you attempt to make a leap, you might squat down in preparation. This would be the anticipatory action to the big leap.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><h4>Slow in and Slow Out</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Think of Newton's Laws of Motion for this one, namely the first one: What starts at rest wants to stay at rest and what’s in motion stays in motion. Slow in and slow out incorporate this into an animated piece by having more sketches (frames) where the object would be slower and fewer sketches in where the object will be faster.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><h4>Follow-Through and Overlapping Action</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>This principle is when the secondary parts of the main body of the subject follow along the path of motion. When a girl swiftly turns her head, her ponytail would be swung about thanks to the initial motion, the ponytail engaging in this principle.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><h4>Timing</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Timing is the amount of frames per second, which would give you the speed of the actions. The more frame means a slower action and fewer frames gives you a faster action.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><h4>Straight-Ahead and Pose to Pose</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>This is basically how you are implementing your sketches.</p>
            <p>Straight-Ahead is when you just sketch each action as you go along. Pose to Pose is when you first sketch out the important moments of the action, such as the starting point and the ending point, before you go back and fill in the rest of the action.</p>
            <p>Both are useful in certain situations, like pose to pose is good for getting the timing of certain actions down while straight-ahead can have a more organic feel to it. It all depends on what you need.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><h4>Staging</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Staging is the viewpoint of the audience and arrangement of the subjects in your film. Choosing the staging helps in communicating what’s happening and different angles of the same scene can have different impressions on your audience.</p>
            <p>A good thing to remember when you’re posing characters is imagining them as shadow puppets: If you can clearly see what they are doing when they’re in this state, you got good staging.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><h4>Solid Drawing</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>This one is basically depicting your subjects in 3D space.</p>
        </div>
            
        <button class="accordion"><h4>Secondary Action</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>This action acts as an emphasis to the main action that is happening. An example of this could be that your main character is talking angrily to one of her friends and is strangling whatever is in her hand.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><h4>Exaggeration</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Remember those times when cartoon characters were so shocked, their jaws dropped? Literally, onto the ground. This is an example of exaggeration, where blowing normal proportion to more exaggerated scales can make an emotion more defined and add a degree of appeal visually. Speaking of appeal…</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><h4>Appeal</h4></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>This one is a little more subjective, but it basically gives your character visual appeal, making them engaging and interesting. The audience will want to follow the character on their adventure when the character can appeal to them in some form. Applying previous principles, like squash and stretch, aids in a character’s visual appeal.</p>
