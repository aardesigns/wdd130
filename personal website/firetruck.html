        <h2>Option 3</h2>
        <p>Sorry, but this one isn't the lie.</p>
        <p>This was during the wintertime a few years ago when this event had happened. One of my brothers was pretty ill and had a seizure. In a frantic rush, my mom and I rushed him to the clinic to get him checked out. This was going to take some time and the rest of my siblings were left alone at the house and needed someone to watch over them. We only had one car at the time, which my mom had, my dad was at work since Mom dropped him off, and I didn't have a license at the time so I couldn't drive the car. I couldn't walk home either because, while home was pretty close by to the clinic where we drove my sick brother to, I hadn't bothered to put on shoes or a jacket in the rush to get to the car in he garage.</p>
        <p>The solution came in the form of the fire department. See, the fire fighters were finishing up a job at the clinic before driving back to the station and, since I was on the way back, they offered to give me a ride back home.</p>
        <p>So that is how I got a ride on a firetruck. To make the story even happier, my brother recovered without any problems. Yay!</p>

        <p>Either way, this option isn't the lie. Try again!</p>
